<h1>Taylor Pool</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>I'm a roboticist specializing in state estimation and controls.
I enjoy applied mathematics.
Some of my favorite topics are optimization, linear algebra, graph theory, optimal control, and factor graphs.
I completed my undergraduate in Applied and Computational Mathematics at Brigham Young University in 2022.
I'm currently a graduate student in the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University working under Dr. Michael Kaess.</p>

<h2>Core Values</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Integrity. Be honest even when nobody else is around.</li>
  <li>Labor. Work hard every day. Earn my job each day. Don't take anything for granted.</li>
  <li>Gratitude. Recognize the kindness from others.</li>
  <li>Dilligence. Every day is important</li>
</ul>

<h2>Research</h2>
<p>I research the robust fusion of IMU, Stereo Camera, and LIDAR for odometry in challenging environments.</p>

<h2>Work Experience</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Lawrence Livermore National Lab was amazing.</li>
  <li>Shield AI was my first introduction to the startup culture.</li>
  <li>BYU MAGICC Lab for autonomous drone technology</li>
  <li>BYU Dr Webb working with reservoir computer systems</li>
  <li>DARPA RACER project lead on state estimation</li>
</ol>

<h2>Fun Projects</h2>
A common theme across my fun projects is a desire to dive into the low-level details.
I that thousands of hours were spent developing tools like Eigen, Ceres, and GTSAM.
However, my appreciation for these projects grew after writing my own implementations.
I have a much better understanding of certain design decisions as a result.

<ol>
  <li>sabai: a C++ 20 linear algebra library leveraging ranges for lazy evaluation rather than expression templates a la Eigen</li>
  <li>onogawa: a C++20 geometry library using quaternions and points for Lie groups S2, SE(2), S3, SE(3)</li>
  <li>autodiff: a C++20 automatic differentiation and optimization library (currently supports forward differentiation).</li>
</ol>

<h2>Hobbies</h2>
<ul>
  <li>I have played the violin since age 5. I played in a symphony at BYU during my undergraduate and still play in church sometimes!</li>
  <li>I speak 4 languages (English, Spanish, Thai, and Lao)</li>
  <li>I love to swim, cycle, and run. Was training for a half-Ironman but got injured so reevaluating at the moment.</li>
  <li>I love to scuba dive! I've dove in Utah, San Diego, and Catalina.</li>
</ul>
